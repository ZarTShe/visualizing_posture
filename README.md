# Posture Analysis and Visualization for Physiotherapist Health Monitoring
This project was conducted for a community health clinic to assess how long physiotherapists remain in the same posture. Prolonged static postures can be detrimental to health, so we visualized their posture over fixed time intervals to monitor and analyze their movement patterns. The data was collected using a customized posture app.
